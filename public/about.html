<h1>About Me - Jack Crabtree</h1>
<p>I just turned 30 years old today! There is a lot I am ready to figure out, and while my 20s was an amazing decade, I expect this next one to be even better. 
  I currently live in Annapolis, but would love to one day live in New York City! 
</p>

<p>I like to think of myself as a having high standards but simple needs. 
  I like to spend my time in ways that make me feel like I am bettering myself. 
  Some of my favorite things to do are exercising, reading, writing, and learning. 
</p>

<p>I recently stepped away form my job at Modus Solutions, a company I co-founded that provides copier/printer solutions. 
  I am now looking at how to equipment myself with skills, expertise, and the ability to work in a remote or in-person settings. 
  I am interested in web-development for a few reasons. 
  First, I wanted to learn a skill that I could use anywhere. 
  Second, I wanted to learn something that there was demand for in the marketplace. 
  Although AI will do a lot of coding in the future, I know that the ability to learn how things work (the nuts and bolts under the hood) will always be important. 
  Lastly, I have had several ideas myself for applications that I would like to try to bring to fruition. 
  I really enjoyed building things, specifically Legos, when I was younger, and I am looking to see if I could get the same enjoyment out of software/web development that I did from legos. 

  I love film, and would one day like to produce movies <p></p>

  Here are some of my goals for the next decade: 

<p>
  <h3>Produce an oscar winning film </H3>
  <h3>  Provide Angel Investment to a company that goes public </h3>
  <h3>Provide my parents with a million dollars to enjoy their retirement years </h3>
  <h3>Have a recurring monthly (passive) income of 10,000 dollars from my investments </h3>
  <h3> Find my teammate for life </h3>
  <h3>Financially prepared to have children and start a family</h3>
