<h1>The best movies according to Jack</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>   
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is an time great story, soundstrack
    This is my general all-time favorite. Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances
</p>

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>Amazing action, great story, great cast. Russell Crowe does amazing as Maximus, who must fight to make things right after being betrayed, outcast, and left for dead</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>The greatest hero's journey of all time begins here. This gets in not just because of episode for, but because the series as a whole has been so instrumental in my life </p>
